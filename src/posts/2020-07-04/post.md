# Createing your static markdown blog

As a JS developer sometimes I need to run away from JS in my projects. In this way I created this static blog where posts are written in markdown syntax.

On server there are only `.html` files. NO JS (with little exception for tracking pixel). Thanks for this site is extremally fast.
